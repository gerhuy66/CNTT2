OPEN TO FREELANCE WORK - TẾT & SHORT-TERM PROJECTS This Tết I'm taking on more freelance projects! During my first Tết in college, this friend of
mine asked me to help her put together the next year's calendar for her Facebook community page. I made my first VND500.000 as a freelancer (very cheap!) in
addition to some basic learnings about content planning. Working some Tết hours has become my tradition ever since. I write for fun, not to mention that I could also
make a little extra money while spending quality time with my family. This is to explain I am no work addict haha. I have helped curate content for some beloved
brands, including but not limited to Ford, Carlsberg, Grab, etc. I can write in Vietnamese quite ok. For English, I am trying to be more well-versed but still 100%
comfortable to offer help with. More of my content portfolio can be found here: https://lnkd.in/g2aRBmX I love making friends out of strangers too. If you think I can
help you in any way, shoot me an email via tule0129@gmail.com.
