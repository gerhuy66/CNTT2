	My Holland - MBA, MA - EQ and Org Psychology CEO Sounds like it's hardly groundbreaking research as I'm sure most of us would've been aware of this for decades, including my mother whose father came back from WW2 with PTSD, drank heavily and as a result was violent at home. This video was filmed in a small house during a visit in which the family invited me into their home and provided lunch and a few drinks for an hour or so. It was an excellent insight into how some people live in Vietnam. If you'd like to promote your research, please do elsewhere.
	Saving that for the cinematic version!
	No one is asking you to, but what you didn't see in this video is that the entire family chipped in, from farming & catching the fish, preparing it, cooking it & cleaning up afterwards.
	Depends how hard you go!
