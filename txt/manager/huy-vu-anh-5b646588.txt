	You can find many industrial zones in Vietnam, but there is no place like DEEP C. We are proudly one of its kind. Come to discover!
	Brilliant!
	Fascinating site witnessed early hours yesterday while on a short flight from Port City Chittagong to Dhaka .... because of current global context and due to less bb imports most of lighter barges become unemployed and anchored. for sure they are not maintaining social distances as it appears!
	Vietnam's seaport growth in January 2021: - Throughput: 61 million tons, up 17% over the same period in 2020 - Containers: 2.2 million TEUs, up 27% over the same period in 2020 - Export/Import: 734,000/679,000 TEUs - The most robust growth witnessed in: Haiphong (up 26%), Ho Chi Minh City (up 27%), and Cai Mep - Thi Vai (up 29%) Source: Vietnam Maritime Administration Photo: Haiphong port & DEEP C Industrial Zones Vietnam
