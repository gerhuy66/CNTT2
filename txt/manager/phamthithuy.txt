Hieu T. Ha
Business Consultant at SimCorp
May 12, 2011, Hieu T. was senior to Thuy but didn’t
manage directly
Received (1) Given (0)
Thuy makes a sharp and meticulous equity analyst, someone not to be taken for granted in our still nascent
domestic market. Even to this day, her insightful research report on a major listed hydroelectric power
company never ceased to impress me.
