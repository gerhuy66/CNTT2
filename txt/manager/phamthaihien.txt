I consider Hien professional with an extensive knowledge of the education industry with advance marketing
skills. Hien has a strong international experience which can help her a valuation member for any team and
organization. Hien is a great person. I recommend Hien since she can work well for any team.
I got to know Hien as an institutional rep for Canada and since then she has proven herself to be a well
connected, result-oriented professional in the education industry in Vietnam. Canadian education is sure lucky
to have someone like Hien promoting them.
