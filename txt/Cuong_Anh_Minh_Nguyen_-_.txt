Profile
I have learnt Python, based on the personal projects I did, I have little 
experience in building and hosting a website, doing some Python scripts to 
play guessing game, automated browser and scrapping data to sort . Right 
now, I am self-learning some basic fundamentals like data structures and 
algorithms and doing some projects with my friends. I have interested in Cloud 
computing and DevOps. My goal is to earn an internship or fresher position in any 
Python-relevant, cloud computing or DevOps positions.
