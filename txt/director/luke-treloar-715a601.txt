I had the pleasure of managing Phuc ("Ruby") during he eventful sojourn with us. I found is intellectual
curiosity and desire to push the envelope of what is traditionally expected of an intern refreshing. Expect big
things to come.
Mark was a wonderful addition to our team. He brought creativity and energy to every endeavor we tackled.
Highly recommend him for Strategy and creative thinking type positions.
