	IDP and its Global Leadership Team are proud supporters of the Diversity Council Australia’s #IStandForRespect campaign. At IDP, we have pledged to: • Stand against gendered harassment and violence in all its forms. • Commit to taking steps in our organisation to address sexual and sex-based harassment to make the workplace safe for everyone.
	Thanks Jet!
	The doctors studied very hard to improve their English with a short period of time. Very much admire their efforts, the mission is big so they have high motivation to improve themselves!
	ACET (Australian Center of Education and Training - IDP Education Vietnam) is proud to contribute to the improving English capability for 175 Military Hospital doctors to serve in South Sudan for peacekeeping mission. Wish all the doctors good health, overcome all obstacles to complete the mission. #acet #idpeducation #peacekeeping #healthcare
