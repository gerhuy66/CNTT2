--
May 14, 2010, Oliver was a client of Mark’s
Received (1) Given (2)
Mark greatly assisted me in sourcing candidates for an oil and gas position that was outside the more
“traditional” roles that recruitment agencies tend to prefer. He was always happy to listen to our changing
requirements and his well-constructed advice inevitably led to excellent results.
