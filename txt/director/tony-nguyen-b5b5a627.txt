	ONLINE MEDIATION IS NO LONGER A FOREIGN ANIMAL TO VIETNAM I’m delighted to see the results of more than 6 months of fully commited hardwork by both technical and content teams of VMC and Youlaw has finally given birth to the new brainchild MedUp. Today is an important day for ADR Vietnam: the first mediation center in Vietnam VMC will officially put an online mediation platform into operation, opening a new era of mediation activities. All steps from filing, payment of fees, scheduling meetings, sharing documents to organizing meetings, drafting successful mediated agreement, can be completed by just a few mouse clicks. I am very pleased to be involved in both the hardware and software of this significant project, as an investor of the technology infrastructure system, as well as the content consultant. Thank you very much to the dream team of #Youlaw and #VMC Duc Ngoc Nguyen, Dao Nhu Ngoc Linh, Huong Pham, Tu Tran, ... for working hard together to create this wonderful made-in-Vietnam product! https://lnkd.in/gkdWz2D #mediation #technology #vietnam #innovation
