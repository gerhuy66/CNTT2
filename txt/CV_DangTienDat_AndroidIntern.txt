PROFILE
CONTACT
I am an open-minded 
person. I am always willing 
to learn new knowledge, 
especially relating to 
Android. Apart from my 
passion for Android, 
English is also a strength of 
mine. In fact, I often 
expand my technological 
knowledge by reading and 
watching articles and 
videos in English from 
reliable online sources.
